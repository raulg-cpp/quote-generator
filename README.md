# Quote generator
This is a quote generator inspired by the [frontEnd Challenge from FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine). It's a very simple website that loads a quote when you press a button.
